<h1><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">It's all in the name</span></strong></h1>
<p>     ""Black Sheep"" wasn't chosen by accident. We believe that everyone has felt a little different at some point in their life; we think that you should lean into that difference. Our goal is to redefine ""the heard"" and build a community of like-spirited ""Black Sheep"", using specialty coffee as our medium.</p>

<h1><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Where we come from</span></h1>
<p>     Black Sheep Coffee Roasters was opened in August of 2015 by Lucas Spinosa with the help of his family and friends. Lucas spent his early life working and playing in his dad's bakery ""Spinosa's Bakery"" where he found his love of people. After a few years of playing music, he stumbled onto an opportunity to build a community space of his own in <em>Black Sheep</em>. </p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0538/1659/0531/files/Screen_Shot_2022-11-24_at_12.28.30_PM_480x480.png?v=1669310953"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""/></p>
<h1><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Why specialty coffee?</span></h1>
<p>         It's simple, specialty tastes better, and it values the coffee farmer as highly as every other part of the chain. We made a conscious decision to better ourselves and our craft year over year. We strive to source coffees from farmers we have met (in-person or virtually) and establish relationships to last a lifetime. These relationships not only make our experiences more pleasant, they also establish trust and help both parties to raise the bar every season.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0538/1659/0531/files/6C132FAA-3ED4-488A-8389-5F78E14C8321_1_105_c_480x480.jpg?v=1669311380""/></p>
<h1><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">More than coffee</span></h1>
<p>     Our first love is people; and nothing brings people together like coffee and good conversation. Black Sheep has been a place for first gigs, first dates, book releases, and more. This is also the place where Lucas met his wife Katie (Mrs. Black Sheep). Every year we host dozens of fundraisers for local charities, sponsor scholarships in local high schools, support kids sports teams, and travel to origin to source great coffee and see how we can help them improve their operations. </p>

<h1 class=""post-title"">Good Coffee, Food, and Good People - The Black Sheep Lounge</h1>
<meta charset=""utf-8""/>
<p>Interested in starting your own entrepreneurial journey in food and beverage but unsure what to expect? Then read up on our interview with <strong>Lucas Spinosa</strong>, owner of <strong>The Black Sheep Lounge</strong>, located in Welland, Ontario, Canada.</p>
<h3 id=""what-s-your-business-and-who-are-your-customers"">What's your business, and who are your customers?</h3>
<p>Black Sheep is a community first and foremost. In 2015, we opened our doors for the first time as a coffee shop with the mission of providing a much-needed safe space for Wellanders. Over the years, Black Sheep has taken coffee exponentially more seriously- now roasting direct trade coffee multiple times per week.</p>
<p>Our role in the community has expanded into monthly fundraisers, awareness campaigns, and providing the space for groups that don't feel welcome in other places. We now have the privilege of shipping our coffee across the country to other coffee lovers!</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8""/>
<h3 id=""tell-us-about-yourself"">Tell us about yourself</h3>
<p>Hi, Lucas here! Nice to meet you! I got my first taste of small business from my maternal grandfather (he owned one of the most iconic restaurants in Niagara Falls, ON. for 50 years). Some of my earliest memories are watching him glide from table to table, greeting his guests with enthusiasm- all the while I was dropping scrambled eggs on the floor... Although not a business owner quite yet, I watched my father oversee a large baking operation for my entire childhood.</p>
<p>When I turned 8, and my dad was 37, he opened Spinosa's Bakery (our family last name). The bakery signalled the beginning of a new era and mindset for the entire family. As a kid, I never saw the stress of being a business owner from my dad. Sure, we had many long days, got many pairs of jeans covered with flour, and took long road trips to buy used equipment from strange people, but he always made it for my younger brother and me. Almost 20 years, it still feels the same.</p>
<p>As much as I love the bakery, I am no baker. When I turned 18, I took up the opportunity to play music semi-professionally in the U.S. After a few years of that, an opportunity to open a café presented itself, and I took it. Coffee is for sure one of the great loves of my life - but people take the cake. I wanted to be able to graze from table as my grandpa once did. I wanted to give friendly hellos, remember names, challenge ideas, help people who needed it while simultaneously guzzling an unfathomable amount of coffee. I wanted to create a fun-loving environment like my dad. Fortunately, I get to enjoy the pleasures of this every day!</p>
<h3 id=""what-s-your-biggest-accomplishment-as-a-business-owner"">What's your biggest accomplishment as a business owner?</h3>
<p>Accomplishments symbolize goals that have been surpassed. I have set many boring financial goals, but I believe the most important accomplishment I've achieved is flexibility. When things pop up, I am able to jump and adapt, push meetings, close for a few days, or host a party for my family. Having the freedom to choose is worth the sacrifices that come with entrepreneurship in my life.</p>
<h3 id=""what-s-one-of-the-hardest-things-that-come-with-being-a-business-owner"">What's one of the hardest things that come with being a business owner?</h3>
<p>I believe the hardest thing about being a business owner (especially in the service industry) is finding the right balance between what you want to sell and what you have to sell. For example, I own a coffee shop, and I'm passionate about coffee. I would love to have a café that only sells the things I love to drink since I would be passionate about every item. Realistically, that doesn't fly for most places.</p>
<p>We also sell tea, hot chocolate, juices, etc. It doesn't mean we don't take these things seriously. We do - it just means we have to try a little harder to make sure that most of the people that walk through the door can have a similar experience in quality.</p>
<h3 id=""what-are-the-top-tips-you-d-give-to-anyone-looking-to-start-run-and-grow-a-business-today"">What are the top tips you'd give to anyone looking to start, run and grow a business today?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Understand why you want to start a business. Do you have a great idea? Are you passionate about a specific field? It's important to understand because passion businesses operate very differently from those focusing on ""the numbers."" Both are incredibly exciting but are NOT the same.</li>
<li>Demographics! One thing I seriously overlooked in the beginning. You need to know who you are selling to. How old are they? What area do they live in? All of this matters!</li>
<li>Understand that your business is only second to family. Your staff depends on you to keep the business running smoothly. If you don't, they could lose their homes in the worst cases. Don't underestimate the damage caused by a lack of/ or poor leadership.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=""is-there-anything-else-you-d-like-to-share"">Is there anything else you'd like to share?</h3>
<p>Leading the Black Sheep is one of the greatest privileges of my life. I am surrounded by friends &amp; family. I met my girlfriend (now Fiancé) here, and many of my favourite conversations have happened between these walls. If you want to start a business- do it. Don't miss out on your chance to change your life forever.</p>

<p>     MBS is an acronym that can be seen on a few products and items at our cafe and on our site! Cupcakes, candles, and other goodies adorn this cute little nickname given to the Matriarch of the Black Sheep; Lucas' mom- Melissa! If you haven't figured it out by now, MBS stands for ""Momma Black Sheep"". Around 2016 Melissa started making cupcakes for special occasions to sell at the shop and quickly customers fell in love. Within a few months people were coming in asking for cupcakes from Momma Black Sheep and the name stuck. </p>
<p>     After a year of making candles at home, MBS turned her hobby into a business; selling her ""MBS Specialty Candles"". These beauties are made from 100% soy wax, with crackling wood wicks, and a variety of natural scents that add a light pleasant smell to any space.</p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">What is ""Direct-Trade"" anyway?</h1>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">How we source our coffee:</h2>
<p>     When you are buying coffee, you will see an array of different tags (fair trade, specialty, 100% arabica, organic, rainforest certified, etc.). It can be incredibly overwhelming in the beginning of your coffee journey to decipher this code. In this short blog we will cover specifically ""Direct-Trade"", why it's important, and how we fit in to the picture.</p>
<p>     Direct-Trade coffee is when a specialty roaster establishes, and builds upon relationships with farmers across the globe; with the intention on increasing the farmers quality of life, their ability to grow, the quality of the coffee, as well as build on sustainability practices. As it says in the name, one will work DIRECTLY with the farmer in one capacity or another. Sometimes you will discover a farmer, reach out to them, have them send you samples, and voila. Other times you start by working with importers or cooperatives who will connect you with smaller or lesser-known farmers.</p>
<p><img alt="""" height=""365"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0538/1659/0531/files/209FB436-7A05-454A-8555-F5D47A363AEC_1_105_c_480x480.jpg?v=1644158553"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" width=""456""/></p>
<p>     The picture at the top is of our friend Don Roque. He is the owner and farmer at San Ramon in Dipilto, Nicaragua. He and his team are responsible for many favourites at the Black Sheep, like: <a href=""https://blacksheepniagara.com/products/magma"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Magma</a>, Monkey Love 2.0, <a href=""https://blacksheepniagara.com/products/dark-side"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Dark Side</a>, Santa Fuel, and More! Our mission is to increase our transparency, raise the quality of our coffees, introduce you to new things, and do all of this in the most responsible way we are able. </p>
<p>     Direct-Trade in the least compassionate sense is important because it brings us incredible coffee. In the most enlightened sense, it introduces us to incredible coffee farmers, with big ideas, amazing families, and warm cultures. Every year through collaboration and innovation, roasters and farmers discover new and interesting coffees, processing methods, and varieties. </p>
<p>      Help bring specialty, direct-trade coffee to your neighbourhood!</p>

<p>Well, the Lounge is dead.</p>
<p>It has been laid to rest. After almost 7 years it was time to say goodbye to ""Lounge"" and hello to ""Black Sheep Coffee Roasters"". We haven't gone anywhere, we just had to update our name to more appropriately suit what we are- a coffee roaster! </p>
<p>In 2013, 2 years before we opened our doors, we chose the name Black Sheep Lounge for our small Welland café. It was meant to be a caffeine and community hub for the downtown. After a year we somehow turned into a restaurant- and because of the word ""lounge"", many people mistook us for a bar. On top of this, we discovered that the graphic artist that designed our original logo plagiarized the design from another one of his clients. (He thought we wouldn't notice because we are in 2 different countries- well, we did and were pissed). </p>
<p><img alt="""" height=""338"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0538/1659/0531/files/IMG_0704_480x480.jpg?v=1646940859"" width=""254""/><img alt="""" height=""194"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0538/1659/0531/files/IMG_5898_480x480.jpg?v=1646940951"" width=""291""/></p>
<p>In 2020, the pandemic forced us to reevaluate what we were doing. Many things ended up on the chopping block. Other things were examined and doubled down on! We learned that more and more people were brewing coffee from home and avoiding restaurants to save money, and stay safe. This change in lifestyle pushed us to hyper focus on coffee roasting, e-commerce (which was new to us). Since then we had a 5th, 6th, and are going on a 7th anniversary. These milestones deserve the attention of a seasoned, and more mature leader. We decided to soft launch the ""Coffee Roasters"" tagline, slowing switching over logos, signs, merch, etc.</p>
<p>Now, early into 2022 we are 80% done our rebrand, the remaining 20% to be completed by summer of this year! It's not just surface cleaning; this rebrand also came with eduction, pivoting, and reaffirming values. New and more sustainable packaging &amp; takeout cups, more coffee training, more tasting, new dine-in glassware, and more! All of this to say thank you for supporting us and believing in our vision. </p>
<p>We want to continually improve your experience and the quality of our products, so your love and patience have been greatly appreciated &lt;3</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more,</p>

<p>      Art has been an integral part of Black Sheep since day 1! Hundreds of artists have showcased their work here, adorning our walls with love and creativity. We have never charged a fee, nor taken a commission upon a sale. Some pieces have been here for years, others have changed month over month. We look at our walls like a really chaotic living-screensaver. </p>
<p>     So much of what we have become is due to the many artists that create here, or showcase their talents here. Musicians, poets, and visual artists give us the feeling that our building is alive. That feeling can't be bought, or sought after, it can only be built by a community.</p>
<p>     To all of you amazing and talented people out there, we thank you for making our cafe feel more like a home!</p>

<p>Since we first opened our doors in 2015 our goal was to bring high quality specialty coffee to Welland. Certain things were obvious to us, we cant just have good coffee, we needed great tea, sweets, etc. One thing was left out- CHOCOLATE. Don't get me wrong, it was good, it just wasn't great. </p>
<p>Enter REBEL CHOCOLATES! These guys make a top-knotch product using direct-trade, sustainably sourced cocoa. Shipped from Montreal to Welland to up our mocha game!</p>
<p>We wanted to be proud of every beverage equally, and now we are! </p>

<p>As many of you in the Niagara region know, we close our Welland location every year for a little over a week every Christmas. This year is no different, except we are taking a few extra days to make some changes to our space.</p>
<p>The pandemic changed how we now do business. Somethings for the better and somethings (like our indoor seating) for the worse. Having said that, we are taking our Xmas break to paint, do some renos, move shelving around and updating seating.</p>
<p><strong>We will be closed indoors from DEC 24th to JAN 9th</strong></p>
<p><strong>WALK-UP WINDOW OPEN DEC 28th to 30th 10am-2pm</strong></p>

<div></div>
<div>     What's the point in traveling for coffee? Well, there are many reasons! Before I get into the details, let me just say that it has been 2 long years since we have been able to visit our friends and partners in coffee due to the pandemic. That was the largest gap in farm visits since we opened in 2015.</div>
<div></div>
<div>     In 2018 we visited Nicaragua for the first time, that was our first origin trip. Meeting the first coffee producer was an instant revelation. In certain parts of the world it's easy to forget that it takes thousands of people to produce even one thing we enjoy. This is very prevalent in coffee. We wake up, rub our eyes, and instantly start reaching for that first cup. Most of us are completely disconnected from the people that harvest our coffee, process it, ship it, and in many cases- even those that roast it. Our first trip enhanced our appreciation for the people that help to produce coffee, as well as, the plant itself. </div>
<div></div>
<div><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0538/1659/0531/files/6FDA6DBE-0C03-4EEF-B399-C15C9BEB4728_1_105_c_480x480.jpg?v=1675970324"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""/></div>
<div></div>
<div>     Ok, back to why. Of course our appreciation doesn't dwindle- BUT it is easy to have life get in the way. Yearly coffee trips serve as reminders to us that we need to continue to take our part of the chain seriously. Seeing how much this industry supports dozens of families in an area, and how much it means to them really helps to highlight our responsibilities.</div>
<div></div>
<div>     One of the most important aspects of visiting an origin is education. Learning about new processing methods, cultural coffee traditions, fermentation, compost, climate effects, sustainability, &amp; new coffee varietals are only a few subjects for us to enhance our knowledge . This most recent trip to Costa Rica showed us how important fertilizer is in coffee production, and how there is almost never enough.</div>
<div></div>
<div>     One thing that gets overlooked is- how can you call yourself direct trade if you don't trade DIRECTLY with any coffee farmers? The relationships we develop in coffee are far more meaningful than money. If it wasn't, we wouldn't go. Speaking to farmers, seeing their kids running around, noticing the sparkle in their eyes when they tell you about their grandfathers; that's what this is all about. I saw that same sparkle in my grandparents eyes, in my dads, and hopefully my future children will see them in mine.</div>

<div>Seriously? Coffee competition? </div>
<div></div>
<div>For those that don't work in coffee this may come as a surprise but coffee competitions are real, and a load of fun! What's the point? Well, specialty coffee is a relatively in industry in general, especially so in Canada. These comps help to build excitement and foster community amongst coffee professionals and enthusiasts. </div>

17,https://blacksheepniagara.com/blogs/news/the-truth-about-dark-roast-coffee,"<image:title>The truth about ""dark"" roast coffee...</image:title>",2023-07-08T14:26:24-04:00,"<div class=""rte rte--indented-images"" itemprop=""articleBody"">
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0538/1659/0531/files/B517DD5F-CA32-4769-970C-818C65E07F66_480x480.jpg?v=1688840373"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""/></p>
<p>The truth is ""dark roast"" is treated like a faux pas in coffee, like a dirty set of words. Dark roast coffee in specialty is new and complicated, so what should we do about it?</p>
<p>To make it easy we need to figure out the ""why"" in specialty. If specialty coffee is synonymous with ethical sourcing and high quality, then why can't dark roast offer that? Truth be told, I'm not a fan of dark roast coffee but many people in my family and friends circle swear by it. As an industry we can leverage the popularity of dark roast coffee to introduce people to specialty. Maybe we can go as far as treating dark roast like a gateway drug to more ""serious"" lighter roasted coffees with crazy tasting notes.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0538/1659/0531/files/F8D6F8D5-35A4-41BE-B205-CB95E62BAE8B_480x480.jpg?v=1688840604"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""/></p>
<p> GATEKEEPING IN COFFEE CAN KICK ROCKS! As long as we preserve the standard of high quality and fairness from producer to consumer, than everything else should be fair game in my opinion. We are in an exciting time in coffee and should be less concerned about what people are drinking and more concerned about where that coffee comes from!</p>
<p>Love you all! </p>

<p>This is our worst kept secret..</p>
<p>In the next couple weeks we are opening our second café location and new roasting headquarters! Opening another café was not something we thought we had in the cards but when the opportunity to open in the beautiful Fenwick countryside presented itself, we couldn't pass it up.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0538/1659/0531/files/40785024-DCC4-440B-BD64-1D4C6FA07CFD_1_102_o_480x480.jpg?v=1698278849""/></div>
<p>Like our Welland location, our Fenwick shop will focus on community, quality coffee, and friendships. The biggest difference will be 2-fold: Firstly, aesthetically it is the opposite of Welland. It's bright, white, and features historical pieces from the original build that survived a fire 30+ years ago. Our goal is to feel like ""Black Sheep"" but show off another side of our personality. The second difference will be in events and education! Yes, Welland does this already albeit, differently. At our Fenwick spot we will be setting up a formalized education and tasting program in our roasting lab. We will be offering courses on pretty much everything coffee, tours of the roasting space, tasting experiences, and more. As for events: since we have much more outdoor space at the farm, we will be hosting many seasonal events, mini festivals, community shindigs, etc.</p>
<p>We can't wait to show off this space to you! We will be posting about our soft opening date in the next week or two!</p>

<p>Well, the day has come!</p>
<p>Yesterday was our first day open at our brand new Fenwick café location, and I thought i'd reflect on it here!</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0538/1659/0531/files/IMG_9810_480x480.jpg?v=1701188098"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""/></p>
<p>     Nov 29th, 2023 is day one on Foss rd, our second home. This project never seemed like it was on our horizon until we were standing right in front of it. Before we knew it, our new roasting HQ turned into a bright, micro Black Sheep. Prior to yesterday we'd spent 45 fridays selling bread and coffee to this beautiful rural location to locals from our roasting space. We were immediately greeted and welcomed by ""Fenwickians"" and we felt an overwhelming sense of homeyness.</p>
<p>     With one full day in the bag, I feel an abundant gratitude for all of you. When we opened our Welland shop in 2015 I never would have pictured this in my future, let alone only 8 years later. Welland provided me with many opportunities, from community events, friendships, city council, podcasting, and meeting Katie my now wife and mother of my child. </p>
<p>     I can't wait to see what this location presents to us!</p>
